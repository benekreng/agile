### Meeting type: Sprint 1 recap and sprint 2 duties 
### Attendees: Connor, Ben, Thavelarn

## Meeting Plan: Review sprint 1 progress and outline tasks for sprint 2

Meeting Outcomes: The team outlined to progress made on sprint 1 which was a basic HTML skeleton for the navigation bar produced by Ben and Thavelarn as well as sample code to be integrated in the program at a later point by David, Kashka and Connor.

The rest of the team worked on developing JavaScript on external sample web pages with the following functionality
+ Reactive navigation bar
+ Accessing native Operating System file managers via HTML and then loading a specified file 

The overall timeline was outlined in the meeting. Ideally the MVP should be complete around sprint 5 and then the reamining sprints can be used to develop further features. This is annotated on the project timeline Excell. 

Once the HTML is complete the JavaScript will be implemeted into the system. This is likely going to occur after sprint 3.
