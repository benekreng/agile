### Date: 7 May 22
### Meeting type: Initial
### Attendees: Connor, Ben, Kashka, Sandra

## Meeting Plan: Group introductions and initial scoping for the project.

Meeting Outcomes: The team decided that a utility webpage that can process data into browser generated data orientated graphics would be an appropriate project for the CM2020 deliverables. All team members felt comfortable with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Utilising CSS and JavaScript would allow appropriate styling and functionality of the web page. The idea to use database implementation for the data was also discussed as well as using the Google Big Query API.

The timeline for each deliverable was discussed and the following deadlines were agreed. 

+ Project proposal (Midterm assessment, 30% of grade) – must be submitted no later than 27 Jun 22, the team agreed to aim for submission on 26 Jun 22.
+ Full project submission (final deliverable, 70% of grade) – must be submitted no later than 5 Sep 22, the team agreed to aim for submission on 4 Sep 22.

A full ‘Gant chart’ style timeline will be created by Connor. This will outline key markers in the project’s evolution. The midterm has 7 weeks until the required submission and the main deliverable has 10 weeks after the midterm.  

The project, and all associated documentation, will be stored on a GitHub repository. This will be created by Ben and all team members will be added to the repo. This will eventually be uploaded as part of the final deliverable.

Due to family/work commitments meetings will likely be at the weekend. This is to be refined in the future but Saturdays at GMT1600 are the proposed meeting time. This meeting was conducted with Google Meet successfully and will likely be used again unless found to be unworkable by team members.

The project will likely follow the timeline depicted by the Software Development Life Cycle1. Initial planning has been completed during today’s meeting. To further refine the core plan each team member will research web services that offer a similar service to the web page proposed for the project. The results of this research will be outlined in the next meeting. 

In preparation for the next stage of the project all team members have been asked to look at ‘big picture’ requirements that they feel are appropriate for the project. These will be discussed in the next team meeting 

The Slack channel will be used for all forms of team communication. This will serve as a rolling audit log for the project progress as well as allow interoperability regardless of time zone. 

Tasks
+ All Team members: 
    + Review Google Big Query
    + Research websites that provide a similar service to the webpage that has been proposed
    + Establish basic requirements of the service
+ Ben
    + Create project GitHub repository
+ Connor
    + Create project timeline 

Notes: Connor will not be at the next meeting (14 May 22) due to a hospital appointment. His findings will be posted to the team Slack channel prior to the meeting.
