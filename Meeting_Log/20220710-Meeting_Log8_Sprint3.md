### Attendees: Connor, Ben, Thavelarn, Kashka

## Meeting Plan: Review sprint 2 progress and outline tasks for sprint 3

Meeting Outcomes: The team have made great progress in the last sprint and the front end is largely complete. The side menu works with embedded JS and matches the final prototype.

The backend has developped along side the front end with several features implemented. The button that will feed as a mechanism for generating the charts with charts.js has been implemented as well as the button that users will interface with to load a file. The system can can successfulyl load a file and then manipulate it as required.

The full stack code is contained under the Code/Frontend/HTML AND CSS.

Due to the accelerated work from Thavelarn and Ben the project is ahead of schedule. The MVP is expected to be complete by the end of the next sprint. All additional time will be used to add more features to the tool. The next milestone is implementing charts.js with pre-built and user uploaded data.
