## Meeting Plan: Review sprint 3 progress and outline tasks for sprint 4

Meeting Outcomes: The team reviewed the progress with the project. 

Basic backend features like using pre-loaded data and exporting the generated graphics has already been compelted.

There was commented phases still to be implemented in the front end. Ben and Thavelarn will add all front end features and then the backend team will implement the changes.

Kashka will create a function that will help csv parsing. The function will pull the titles and seperate data columns from a csv file. the function will play into a seperate window that will appear when the user uploads their own data. This window will give the user the option to select the data they wish to display on the chart.

David will look to connect the charts.js output to user uplaoded data.

Connor will work on implementing a navigation bar.

The team decided the program should start error management and an error popup should be displayed to the user when an error state occurs.
