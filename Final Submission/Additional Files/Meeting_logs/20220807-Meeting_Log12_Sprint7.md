### Date: 7 Aug 22
### Meeting type: Sprint 6 recap and sprint 7 duties 
### Attendees: Connor, Thavelarn, David

## Meeting Plan: Review sprint 6 progress and outline tasks for sprint 7

Meeting Outcomes: Week 20 would be used to generate the final report

David will work on linking the charts.js to the arrays created by parsing the users input.

Connor will work on the export functionality so it downloads the chart graphic as a file instead of opening it in a new tab. He will also work on the radio buttons to select the file download type as the Ux would be more clean as a listbox. 

The code will be re-factored by the backend because it currently has elements that are spread across multiple files. Re-factoring will increase readibility of the project. Kashka will help with commenting code that already exists in the project

Accessibility tags and descriptions are still required. This will likely be taken on by Ben with help from Thavelarn where required.

Vercel will be used to host the project at the end of development. Ben will have to set this up as he is the originator of the GitHub repo. David will asssit Ben in hosting the site on Vercel when the project is at that stage.
