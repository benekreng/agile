### Project scope

### Overview
This project is the main deliverable for the University of London CS BSc module CM2020. The project will create a browser based piece of software that will allow the user to load their own data, or use pre-built data if requried, and it will then produce Data Science graphics and statistical analysis for the data provided. If the user decides to upload their own data the software will manage any data errors without crashing the main program.

The project is governed and assessed by the University of London staff. The CM2020 team members have local governance and are responsible for the production of all elements of the project to include documenttion and source code. 

The project will be completed in a series of phases that relate to the software lifecycle. These phases are Planning, Requirements, Design & Prototyping, Software development, Testing, Deployemnt, Operations and Maintenance. Within each phase there are a series of key milstones/markers that will be achived. If found to be appropriate the cycle may loop back to a previous state if features / functionality are identified as desirable or essential. The core development approach will be **INSERT DEVELOPMENT STYLE**

**INSERT DELIVERABLES.MD FILE ONCE COMPLETE** 

The project has the following deliverables on the outlined deadlines:
+ **MIDTERM:** 
  + Date: 27 Jun 22
  + Description: The project outline with all proposed documentation
+ **SUBMISSION:** 5 Sep 22
  + Date: 5 Sep 22
  + Description: The full project submission with all relevant files, documents and git logs.

The project will incur no financial cost to complete but it will require a joint amount of time committed by each team member. The project will require approximately 1-2 Hours of work per team member to produce the core deliverables and then 0:30-1 Hour for the weekly team meeting. 

The project assumes the user has a basic level of computer knowledge and is able to naviate and use a modern computing operating system, a modern web browser (such as Google Chrome etc.) and also is able to utlise and work with files on an oepraitng system. The project also assumes that the user has sufficient web browsing software installed on the operating system in order to run the software. The user is also assumed to have appropriate privalege to run JavaScript from within a HTML file. The project utilises maps.js and p5.js to generate the graphics required for the project. As such any errors relating to these modules will be assumed to be of no fault to the development team as they were created by a third party. The project will not have any networking functionality and will be assumed to be a locally ran file on the users computer.
