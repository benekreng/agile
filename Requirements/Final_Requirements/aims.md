# add aims of the project here

The aim of this project is to provide the user with a simple tool that performs data analysis with minimal input from the user. The tool will provide graphics on a data provided by the user or on pre-loaded data built into the software. Once complete the tool will give the user the option to export the processed data and/or graphics for use later.
